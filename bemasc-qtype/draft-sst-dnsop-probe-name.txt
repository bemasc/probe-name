1.  Introduction

   In the Domain Name System (DNS, [RFC1034]), clients normally send
   queries to a recursive resolver in order to receive the resolution
   results.  However, some clients also send queries merely to check
   that a response is received at all.  We call these queries "DNS
   probes".  DNS probes are used for many reasons:

   *  To determine if the network is working at all.

   *  To detect if a particular address family is connected to the
      global internet.

   *  To check that the client is able to reach the resolver's IP
      address.

   *  To assess the reliability and performance of the network path
      between the client and the resolver.

   *  To establish which transport protocols (e.g., UDP, TCP, TLS
      [RFC7858], QUIC [RFC9250]) are available.

   *  To confirm that the DNS resolver itself is operational.

   When sending a DNS query, the client must choose a QNAME.  Popular
   QNAME values for probes include:

   *  Names owned by the entity performing the probe.

   *  Names used by prominent, high-reliability internet services.

   *  Names operated at the direction of prominent internet
      organizations such as the IETF (e.g., "example.com", [RFC2606]).

   *  Names that form an essential part of the internet infrastructure.

   These choices are pragmatic, but they also present a number of
   downsides for the client:

   *  The response could be delayed if the selected name is not in
      cache.

   *  The probe will return unneeded RDATA, wasting bandwidth.

   *  Depending on the success criteria, the probe could report a
      spurious failure

      -  if the selected name is removed, or experiences an outage.

      -  if the resolver experiences an interruption on its outbound
         link.

   These popular types of QNAME also present some downsides for the
   resolver operator:

   *  The probe may cause the resolver to do more work than necessary,
      especially when the selected name is not in cache.

   *  The operator cannot distinguish probe queries from ordinary
      queries, limiting their understanding of how their service is
      being used.

   *  The operator cannot easily contact the sender of excessive or
      problematic probe queries.

   This specification registers a Special-Use Domain Name for DNS
   probing to avoid these downsides.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Client Requirements

   Clients SHOULD set the QNAME on probe queries to
   "probe.resolver.arpa.".

   Clients SHOULD set the QTYPE to A or AAAA.  Clients that use other
   QTYPEs are at a higher risk of implementation fingerprinting due to
   the distinctive QTYPE.

   Clients SHOULD NOT set the "DNSSEC OK" flag.  Setting this bit causes
   more work for the resolver, but does not provide any benefit to the
   client.

   Clients SHOULD avoid any stub caching, as this would cause probe
   results to be out of date.

   Clients MAY set the "Recursion Desired" flag to either value.
   Setting this flag to 0 reduces load on resolvers that do not
   implement this specification.

4.  Server Requirements

   Upon receiving a query with a QNAME of "probe.resolver.arpa.", DNS
   servers MUST return a valid NXDOMAIN response from the
   "resolver.arpa." locally-served zone [RFC9462].

5.  Security Considerations

   If a resolver operator applies rate limits to queries, it SHOULD NOT
   exclude "probe.resolver.arpa" from such limits.  Queries for this
   name could still be used as part of a high query rate attack.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Special Use Domain Name "probe.resolver.arpa"

   This document calls for the addition of "probe.resolver.arpa" to the
   Special-Use Domain Names (SUDN) registry established by [RFC6761].

6.2.  Domain Name Reservation Considerations

   In accordance with Section 5 of [RFC6761], the answers to the
   following questions are provided for this document:

   1) Are human users expected to recognize these names as special and
   use them differently?  In what way?

   No.  This name is principally intended to be useful to resolver
   operators, and should never be seen by ordinary users.

   2) Are writers of application software expected to make their
   software recognize these names as special and treat them differently?
   In what way?

   Yes.  Writers of DNS resolver monitoring software are expected to
   categorize queries for these names as distinct from ordinary user-
   generated queries.

   3) Are writers of name resolution APIs and libraries expected to make
   their software recognize these names as special and treat them
   differently?  If so, how?

   No.  Stub resolvers process these names in the ordinary fashion.

   4) Are developers of caching domain name servers expected to make
   their implementations recognize these names as special and treat them
   differently?  If so, how?

   No.  These names are subject to ordinary caching logic.

   5) Are developers of authoritative domain name servers expected to
   make their implementations recognize these names as special and treat
   them differently?  If so, how?

   No.  Queries for these name are not intended to reach authoritative
   domain name servers.

   6) Does this reserved Special-Use Domain Name have any potential
   impact on DNS server operators?  If they try to configure their
   authoritative DNS server as authoritative for this reserved name,
   will compliant name server software reject it as invalid?  Do DNS
   server operators need to know about that and understand why?  Even if
   the name server software doesn't prevent them from using this
   reserved name, are there other ways that it may not work as expected,
   of which the DNS server operator should be aware?

   These names have no special impact on DNS server operators beyond
   those already implied by the status of "resolver.arpa." as a Locally
   Served Zone.

   7) How should DNS Registries/Registrars treat requests to register
   this reserved domain name?  Should such requests be denied?  Should
   such requests be allowed, but only to a specially-designated entity?

   These names are inside an existing Locally Served Zone
   ("resolver.arpa."), so the question of registration requests is moot.
